# GitHub Sync

This is a AntCMS plugin which allows you to automatically sync a GitHub repo as your content source using the cronjobs.

## Install 

Download the repository zip. Under the `Githubsync` directory open the `Config.yaml` file and specify at a minimum the owner, repo, and branch you wish to use as a download source. Save the file and then copy the entire `Githubsync` folder into your AntCMS plugins directory.

Finally, run the cronjob to verify it works!
